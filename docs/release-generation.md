# Release generation

This document outlines the steps to generate and publish a new release for the project, following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) guidelines.

## Automated Release (Recommended)

To create a new release automatically, run:

```bash
node scripts/release.js
```

This script will:

1. **Validate the environment**: Ensures you're on the `main` branch with a clean working tree
2. **Run validation checks**: Executes `lint:docs`, `test`, and `build` to ensure everything passes
3. **Determine the next version**: Analyzes commits since the last tag using `git-cliff` to determine the appropriate version bump (major/minor/patch) based on conventional commits
4. **Generate CHANGELOG.md**: Automatically creates changelog entries from commit messages, grouped by type (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
5. **Update package.json**: Bumps the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
6. **Commit and tag**: Creates a commit with message `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` and creates the git tag `vX.Y.Z`
7. **Provide instructions**: Shows next steps for pushing changes

After running the script, push the changes:

```bash
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

## Alternative: Makefile-based Release

The project also includes a Makefile-based release process that requires manual version specification:

```bash
make release-prep              # Validate and check git status
make release VERSION=1.10.0    # Interactive release (updates version, prompts for CHANGELOG)
make release-commit VERSION=1.10.0  # Commit and tag (after CHANGELOG is updated)
```

The automated script (`node scripts/release.js`) is recommended as it:
- Automatically determines the correct version from commits
- Generates the changelog automatically
- Reduces manual work and potential errors

## Requirements

- **git-cliff**: The script uses `npx git-cliff`, which will be downloaded automatically if not installed. For better performance, you can install it globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g git-cliff
  ```

- **Conventional Commits**: All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for the version detection to work correctly.

## Changelog Format

The generated changelog follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format with sections:
- **Added**: New features (`feat:` commits)
- **Changed**: Changes in existing functionality (`docs:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `test:`, `chore:` commits)
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes (`fix:` commits)

Release commits (`chore(release):`) are automatically excluded from the changelog.
