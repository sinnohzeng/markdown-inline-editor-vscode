## [Unreleased]

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- Image hover preview functionality
  - Hover over image alt text to see image preview with size constraints (max 400x300px)
  - Shows image URL and configuration status in hover tooltip
  - Supports absolute paths, relative paths, and external URLs
  - Proper security handling for file vs. remote URIs
- Link hover functionality
  - Hover over links to see target URL
  - Shows configuration status for single-click navigation
- Single-click navigation for links and images (optional, disabled by default)
  - New configuration setting `markdownInlineEditor.links.singleClickOpen`
  - When enabled, single-click opens links/images without requiring Ctrl+Click
  - Works with anchor links, external URLs, and relative file paths
  - Note: May interfere with text selection, so disabled by default
- Shared hover utilities (`hover-utils.ts`)
  - Intelligent caching with LRU eviction (max 20 entries)
  - Image URL resolution supporting multiple path formats
  - Diff view handling integration
- Comprehensive test coverage
  - 57+ passing tests across hover providers, click handler, and utilities
  - Tests for caching, URL resolution, cancellation handling, and edge cases

### Changed
- Image decorations now show pointer cursor on hover (consistent with links)
- Image alt text supports inline formatting (bold, italic) with proper decoration
- Link decorations show link icon (🔗) after link text
- Improved image URL hiding in parser

### Fixed
- Image alt text inline formatting now properly renders bold/italic decorators
- Image hover respects diff view configuration settings
- Proper cancellation token handling in all hover providers

## [1.9.2] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- Selection highlight visibility in code blocks and frontmatter
  - Fixed issue where text selections inside code blocks appeared invisible due to opaque background decorations
  - Added explicit selection overlay decoration using `editor.selectionBackground` to ensure selections remain visible
  - Code block and frontmatter backgrounds are now preserved while selection highlights are properly displayed on top

## [1.9.1] - 2026-01-18

### Changed
- Improved README documentation with better organization and visual demonstrations
  - Reorganized layout for better flow and readability
  - Added syntax shadowing and code blocks screenshots
  - Enhanced demo section with side-by-side image comparisons

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- Enhanced syntax shadowing behavior for leading structural markers
  - Blockquote bars, list bullets, and checkbox icons now stay fully rendered on active lines
  - Raw syntax only appears when caret/selection directly overlaps the marker characters
  - Headings show raw `#` markers and remove heading styling when cursor is on the heading line
  - Ordered list numbers remain always visible (no ghost/raw behavior)

### Added
- Syntax Shadowing Milestone 2: 3-state model (Rendered / Ghost / Raw)
  - Implements scope-based detection for precise syntax marker visibility
  - **Rendered state (default)**: Syntax markers hidden, only formatted content visible
  - **Ghost state**: Cursor on line but not inside construct - markers show at reduced opacity (configurable via `markdownInlineEditor.decorations.ghostFaintOpacity`, default: 0.3)
  - **Raw state**: Cursor/selection inside construct - markers fully visible for editing
  - Uses smallest containing scope for cursor positions, preventing multi-line constructs from being revealed when cursor is only on one line
  - Configuration setting `markdownInlineEditor.decorations.ghostFaintOpacity` to control ghost state opacity (0.0-1.0, default: 0.3)

### Removed
- `markdownInlineEditor.defaultBehaviors.editor.applyDecorations` setting
  - This setting was redundant since users can toggle decorations via the command (`mdInline.toggleDecorations`)
  - Decorations are enabled by default, and users can toggle them on/off as needed
  - The diff view setting (`defaultBehaviors.diffView.applyDecorations`) remains as it serves a distinct purpose

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- Theme-aware background colors for inline code blocks
  - Dark themes: Automatically lighten inline code background (~30% brighter)
  - Light themes: Automatically darken inline code background (~30% darker)
- Automatic theme change detection - inline code colors update immediately when switching themes
- Theme change listener that recreates decorations without requiring restart

### Changed
- Improve inline code visibility in dark themes with better contrast
- Remove borders from inline code decorations for cleaner appearance
- Extract theme detection logic into reusable `isDarkTheme()` helper function
- Extract brightness overlay opacity into `BRIGHTNESS_OVERLAY_OPACITY` constant for maintainability

## [1.7.4] - 2026-01-10

### Changed
- Add bold font weight to checkbox decorations for better visibility

## [1.7.3] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Fix table of contents links broken with CRLF line endings (Issue #33)
- Links in table of contents now work correctly regardless of line ending format (LF or CRLF)
